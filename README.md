# Sam Portfolio 
This is my Web Developer Portfolio which will showcase the projects that I will be taking part in or individual projects that will be mostly for the personal learning purpose.

This portfolio is made using **React**, **Node.js** and **Bootstrap**. I also used Animate.css. Bootstrap components are mostly used so as to help presenting it better. This is one of the first tries to make my portfolio, I plan to better it in the future. If you would help is appreciated. 

If you want, you can copy the portfolio for your personal uses, but don't forget to give me a heads up.
